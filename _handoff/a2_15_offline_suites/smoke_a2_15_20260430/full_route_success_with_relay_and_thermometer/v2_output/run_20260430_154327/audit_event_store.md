- missing_evidence: event store remains reviewer-facing only and does not replace a formal audit ledger
- blockers: event store remains reviewer-facing only and is not a formal audit ledger | system/recovery_retry: Phase remains test_only; richer simulated payload evidence is still missing | Missing signal layers: reference, analyzer_raw, output, data_quality | Linked method confirmation items remain open: Recovery retry scenario confirmation, Safe recovery procedure confirmation | Linked uncertainty inputs remain open: Retry timing tolerance, Fault capture debounce window | Linked traceability nodes remain stub-only: Software event log chain, Recovery audit trail stub

- reviewer_next_step: Keep recovery/retry in test-only reviewer coverage until synthetic payload captures retry timing, fault capture, and audit-trace linkage.
- boundary_digest: Step 2 reviewer readiness only | simulation / offline / headless only | file-artifact-first reviewer evidence | not real acceptance | not compliance claim | not accreditation claim | cannot replace real metrology validation
- non_claim_digest: --
